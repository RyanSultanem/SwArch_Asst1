PHASE2:

	In the second PHASE, the evaluate and printstate methods were added for all the classes. Also the set method was added for the Primitive types so that they take values.
	The implementation of this phase followed the same logic of the first phase, where each operator contains TA pointers to their object, and it is decided at run time what action to perform depnding on their dynamic types.

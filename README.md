PHASE1:
	Was able to make the first phase work using pointers in order to dynamically control the types given to the constructors, and there making sure that the type matches. This however does not generate compile time error, but run time errors if a missmatch occurs.
	In the next phase, I will try to remove this pointer dependency and come up with a better hierarchy, or create more constructors to make sure that we detect the missmatches of types on compile time. Overall it will also have a better architecture, as well as removing the pointers need, which are complicatingt he problem.
